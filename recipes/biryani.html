    </ul>
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
   
        <li>
            Step 1<br>
            Place the basmati rice in a large 
            container and cover with several inches of cool water;<br> 
            let stand 30 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Step 2<br>
            Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cloves, cardamom pods, <br>
            and cinnamon sticks in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. <br>
            Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions are lightly browned, <br>
            about 5 minutes. Stir the garlic paste and ginger paste into the onion mixture; <br>
            cook until the garlic and ginger is fragrant, about 1 minute more. <br>
            Sprinkle the cilantro and mint over the mixture and cook 1 minute more.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Step 3<br>
            Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt.<br>
            Cook and stir the lamb until the meat begins to brown, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Step 4<br>
            Stir the tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper into the mixture; <br>
            continue cooking until the oil begins to separate from the gravy, about 10 minutes. <br>
            Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes.<br>
             Add water as needed to keep the mixture from getting too dry.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Step 5<br>
            Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice <br>
            is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Step 6<br>
            Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala over the rice.<br>
            Spread the fried onion over the lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Stir the saffron and <br>
            warm milk together in a small bowl; pour over the top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid <br>
            and place the pot over low heat;cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.
